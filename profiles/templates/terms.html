With respect to all Submitted Content You have uploaded in the past or elect to upload in the future, post, e-mail or otherwise transmit to or via the Service, LoopNet acknowledges that you retain any applicable ownership rights that You may have with respect to the Submitted Content. You nonetheless grant LoopNet and its affiliates (including other CoStar Group, Inc. companies) and their licensees a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully sub-licensable right and license (through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, adapt, perform, display, publish, translate, prepare derivative works from, modify, distribute, sell, and take any other action with respect to all such Submitted Content (in whole or part), whether submitted in the past or in the future, and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed. Member further acknowledges and agrees that LoopNet may preserve any such Submitted Content, whether submitted in the past or in the future, and may also disclose such Submitted Content in its sole discretion (including without limitation within other products offered by LoopNet and its affiliates, including other CoStar Group, Inc. companies). Member agrees not to submit any Submitted Content to LoopNet unless Member has received all necessary rights and authorizations, including from the photographer or videographer and/or copyright owner of any photographs or videos, to publish and advertise the property listing on Member’s website and LoopNet’s website. Specifically, Member will not submit a photograph if Member received the photograph from a third party information provider under the terms of a license that does not allow posting of such photograph or video on the LoopNet website. Members may only submit videos personally created by them or their direct employees or via LoopNet’s Pro Video™ service. Members may not upload or otherwise submit videos created or produced by third-party video tour providers. Where Member’s listing incorporates content provided by LoopNet or its affiliates, such as property photos or other images or information (collectively, “LoopNet Materials”), Member is granted a limited, revocable, exclusive and non-sub-licensable license to use such LoopNet Materials strictly in connection with Member’s LoopNet listing. All other rights to LoopNet Materials are expressly reserved. The Company may, in its sole discretion but without any obligation to search for such, remove property listings that are alleged to have been submitted in violation of this provision. In addition, the Company may require additional evidence of compliance with this provision from Members who are alleged to have submitted property listings, Submitted Content or other information in violation of these binding Terms and Conditions. The Company will, in its sole discretion, terminate the accounts of, and refuse service to, any Member who repeatedly or knowingly violates these binding Terms and Conditions. Member agrees to maintain accurate contact information (specifically, a valid phone number and email address) in order to submit and maintain active property listings on the LoopNet website. No robot, spider or other automated service may be used to submit listings to the Service. The Company shall have the sole authority to choose the manner in which any property listing will be searched, displayed, accessed, viewed, downloaded, copied, and otherwise used on the LoopNet website and Company shall have the right to modify the property listing in the exercise of its rights under these binding Terms and Conditions. Listings that are not modified or renewed within a 75-day period are automatically changed to “Off Market” and are no longer viewable on LoopNet.com. Member (a) represents and warrants that all properties and associated information provided by Member, including Submitted Content, will be accurate; (b) agrees not to post a property listing on the LoopNet marketplace under a name other than the individually named licensed real estate agent or agents that have been engaged by the property owner to market the property under the terms of a duly executed listing agreement with the owner (shared accounts, e.g. listings@abcrealty.com are strictly prohibited); (c) agrees to administer the properties provided by Member and maintain their accuracy at all times. The Company reserves, in a manner consistent with reasonable commercial business practices, the right to remove all or any part of the property listings posted on the LoopNet website. Member is entirely responsible, and Company accepts no responsibility, for the Submitted Content from the Member. While the Company will undertake reasonable efforts for data backup and business resumption, Member will be solely responsible for retaining back-up copies of all information, photographs and other materials it provides to LoopNet. LoopNet may add digital watermarks to certain parts of your property listing, including photographs. We add these digital watermarks to protect against the copying or further distribution of your photographs without your permission. Member agrees that LoopNet may adjust portions of the information contained within the Service (e.g., within property listings). Any such adjustments will have no material impact on the meaning and interpretation of property listings, but will serve as a means of uniquely identifying the property listings. Member accepts that this is a legitimate and lawful security precaution on the part of LoopNet, and accepts further that in the event that any third party has access to property listings that can be identified as having such unique adjustments, this shall constitute a prima facie breach of security and of these Terms and Conditions.

Payment of fees shall not be contingent on any events other than the delivery of the ordered Deliverables. Any attorney fees, court costs, or other costs incurred in collection of delinquent undisputed amounts shall be the responsibility of and paid for by Customer. If payment is not current, LoopNet may immediately cease to provide any and all Deliverables to the Customer.

                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            LoopNet offers a paid subscription product for those Customers who primarily utilize the Service to actively list and market commercial properties available for sale and/or for lease (“Premium Lister” or “Premium Lister subscription” or “Premium Subscription”).  A Customer who purchases a Premium Lister subscription is a “Premium Customer.” Premium Subscription privileges are granted by LoopNet to individuals exclusively and extend solely to the subscribing Premium Customer. Premium Subscription rights cannot be assigned, sublicensed, distributed, shared, viewed, accessed, or otherwise transferred to anyone other than the subscribing Premium Customer. Moreover, a Premium Customer may not use a Premium Subscription for the benefit of any other broker, appraiser, researcher, analyst, sales person or similar commercial real estate professional, including without limitation those working for the same company or at the same place of business. A Premium Customer is prohibited from using Premium Lister to list properties on behalf of, or for the benefit of, other brokers or commercial real estate professionals working for the same company or at the same office. Such Customer of a Premium Lister subscription is permitted to list solely those listings for which he or she is the listing broker. Premium Subscription privileges are subject to change from time to time and may be subject to property listing, property searching, and member directory searching limitations. Under Premium Lister subscription, one (1) through ten (10) Premium Listing plans are available for purchase online; higher Premium Listing plans are available for purchase by calling (855) 858-3782. Any listing on which the Primary Contact is a Premium Lister and is within its plan will receive Premium exposure; listings above plan will receive exposure on the Company’s www.costar.com site. Customer acknowledges that LoopNet (in addition to its other remedies) can cancel, not renew, and/or prohibit Premium Subscription privileges to any individual, organization, or group that does not abide by the terms and conditions set forth herein and/or can refuse any or all membership privileges. LoopNet also has the right to refuse service to any Customer or company that has delinquent charges that remain unpaid and to impose additional charges to reactivate Premium Subscription or other membership privileges. Premium Subscriptions continue to renew at the prevailing level regardless of Customer’s listing activity on LoopNet.com. Premium Subscriptions will automatically renew to the credit card number provided for initial payment unless the Customer cancels their subscription on the LoopNet Website prior to the renewal date to cancel such subscription. The Company reserves the right to change its fees, payment frequency, or billing methods at any time. The Company will provide timely notice of any such changes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After adding a listing at the Standard exposure level, there will be an option to change current membership level to a Premium Lister with a Premium Listing plan which will provide Premium exposure for the listing. For all plan changes submitted online, the Customer will be charged a prorated change plan fee for the remaining days in current billing cycle, and Customer’s subscription rate will be adjusted commencing with the next bill date. If Customer was above its plan, Service will upgrade the most recently created Standard Listings to Premium until Customer is within its plan. Premium Members may change current membership level to a lower Premium Listing plan by clicking to “Change Plan” under “My Account”. Membership change will take effect end of term for Premium Members in a quarterly or annual commitment. Once effective, service will downgrade the earliest created Premium Listing to a Standard Listing until Customer is within plan or there are no additional listings to downgrade. Prepaid fees will be refunded based on the number of months remaining on the contract period, beginning with the month following receipt of online request submission to change membership level, but may be subject to adjustment according to current monthly product pricing and subject to adjustment for any incentives or discounts provided for said prepayment. No partial month refunds will be provided. The company reserves the right to deactivate complimentary subscriptions granted to Premium Members if there is no search activity for the previous ninety (90) days.

                        <p>
                            Campaigns are available for purchase by Members for member advertising (Premium status not required) by contacting LoopNet at (888) 567-7442. Searchers who click the advertisement can be directed to a lead form. Leads will be available for each campaign by clicking the ‘Leads’ link, accessible via ‘My Ads’. Pricing for each campaign will be determined by the number of available impressions (or views) advertiser desires for a given set of campaign targeting options, including property type, search type (for sale/for lease), and location (zip code). The number of impressions is calculated on the purchase date and remains guaranteed (up to the impression cap provided at campaign purchase) throughout commitment term. Advertising client (“Client”) acknowledges that the average views per month on LoopNet.com varies, therefore the number of views for a campaign will vary month to month. Campaigns are sold on a quarterly or annual commitment, billed to a credit card on a monthly billing frequency. Monthly invoicing is available when a minimum campaign value is met. All campaigns auto-renew for additional terms, equal to initial term, if price remains within ten percent (10%) of original campaign purchase price. If at renewal, market demand has increased the campaign price more than ten percent (10%), Client will be notified via email that the campaign has expired and Client will need to authorize campaign continuation at current market price. At any time, Client may request to cancel the campaign by calling LoopNet at (888) 567-7442. Cancellation requests must be submitted three (3) days prior to the last day of the current campaign to effectively cancel the campaign at the end of term and avoid renewal. All cancellations are effective at end of the initial or renewal term and monthly billing will continue for the full commitment. There are no refunds or early terminations. There are five status phases to an advertising campaign:

Thus, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity, You agree that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief. Any User, Member, Customer, or other individual or entity that violates any term of these binding Terms and Conditions is precluded from enforcing, agrees not to enforce, and covenants not to sue to enforce, any similar contract, including terms and conditions, terms of use and terms of service, asserted by such User, Member, Customer, or other individual or entity, or any affiliate thereof, as binding upon LoopNet and its affiliates, including other CoStar Group companies. Material breach of these binding Terms and Conditions harms the integrity, functionality, and reputation of LoopNet and its affiliates; detracts from Users’ and Customers’ trust in and use of the Service; and unfairly harms, thereby causing damage to, the business of LoopNet. You agree that, in the event You materially breach these binding Terms and Conditions, You will pay LoopNet’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, to be determined by a court or arbitrator, but not less than $30,000, an amount the parties agree would be the minimum reasonable fee for any legal action required to enforce these binding Terms and Conditions.

                              LoopNet's Privacy Statement:

Any user information we collect is considered private and we do not use it or share it except as permitted herein, without the user's permission. We use this personal information at LoopNet to provide the best quality service possible. The following privacy statement summarizes LoopNet's protection and use of any personal information provided by visitors to the LoopNet site.
                              This statement does not apply to any public area of LoopNet's website or services. In the event you submit personal information to contact another member, contact a lister about a listing, create a listing, add a contact on a listing, Professional Directory, LoopNet Profile, such information becomes publicly available and LoopNet is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit to these services, forums, listings, or persons.
                              Information Collected by LoopNet:
                              LoopNet collects user information from several areas of the LoopNet site including the 'New Member Registration' area (where LoopNet collects each user's name, street address, telephone number, email address, and self-selected primary role in real estate); products; business services; the adding and editing of property listings; email forms; and any surveys or contests that LoopNet may sponsor. LoopNet collects individual user search activity for statistical, archival, and business purposes. LoopNet collects financial information (such as billing address) for billing payment and credit card authorization purposes. LoopNet may track the IP address of a user's computer or place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. This is required by LoopNet services to provide automated features.
                              Use of Information Collected:
                              Collected information helps LoopNet better understand its users' needs in order to improve its product and service offerings. Email addresses are used to communicate with members through LoopNews (a weekly email news summary), Promotional emails, Partner emails and for site administration purposes. Users may be deleted from LoopNews, Promotional email and Partner email lists at their request. Personal information may be used to contact users for the purpose of research, product development, marketing, or customer service, if the user has opted to receive such communication. User search activity is collected and analyzed and may be utilized by LoopNet in the aggregate or in the abstract for a variety of business purposes. Financial information is used to bill users for products and services purchased. Except as otherwise stated herein, this information is not shared with anyone outside of LoopNet. We do not collect your credit card information as your credit card information is provided by you directly to our third party payment processing vendor. IP address and cookie log data is analyzed to better understand traffic flows and user preferences. LoopNet may retain the data it collects indefinitely. You may have your personal information deleted or deactivated by sending an email to privacy@loopnet.com. You may be asked to confirm your identity. You will receive a response within 10 business days.
                              Use of Email Tools:
                              You may NOT use the Contact Listing Broker, Send to Friend service or other email services that we offer to send spam (i.e. unsolicited commercial email) or otherwise send content that would violate LoopNet's Terms and Conditions. We may monitor, track or save the use of this feature, but will be under no obligation to monitor, track or save these email messages sent from these tools. If you send an email using the Send to Friend service to an email address that is not registered in our system, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email, and for us to automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. LoopNet stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. We also do not rent or sell these email addresses of un-registered users.
                              Your friend may contact us at privacy@loopnet.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
                              Shared information:
                              We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
                              These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
                              Though LoopNet makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request served on our website and to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
                              LoopNet shares member information in the following areas on the site: Listing Service, Email Alerts and Professional Directory. When a member enters a sale or lease listing in the Listing Service, listing contact information is also entered. During this process, the listing submitter is able to view other members' contact information when he adds another contact beside himself to the listing. In addition, members searching LoopNet can view contact information (name, email and phone number) when they view a property listing profile. LoopNet allows users to share contact information with one another via its Email Alerts service. With Email Alerts users can save their property search criteria to have information about properties that match the specified criteria emailed to them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their contact information to other users who have property listings that match their criteria. This contact information is then shared with the users who have property listings that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in this section or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph, LoopNet does not share individual user search activity information and such activity information remains private to the individual user and to LoopNet. Professional brokers agree to share their contact information and allow all LoopNet users to view their contact information via the LoopNet Professional Directory or via links made available to users on a listing or in an email. LoopNet users LoopNet shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that LoopNet's partners make of customer information will not exceed LoopNet's use of the data. Key billing information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered from users making online purchases of products or services is provided directly to our credit card processing partner, in order to authorize charges to the credit card. LoopNet also uses third party providers to perform email and postal mailings on behalf of LoopNet, but this information (such as name, address and email) is confidential and is not used by the provider for any other purpose.
                              LoopNet does not rent or lease user information to any third party, except as disclosed here. From time to time, LoopNet may obtain information (such as electronic mail addresses) from third party providers. It is our goal to only contact individuals who we believe may have a legitimate business interest in LoopNet based on their membership or participation in other organizations or websites, and who have indicated a willingness to be contacted for this purpose. While LoopNet endeavors to work with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, LoopNet cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.
                              Please be aware that LoopNet was recently acquired by CoStar Group, Inc. ("CoStar"), and as a result all LoopNet customer information, including personal, company and listing information, has been and will be shared with CoStar and its affiliates.

The information may only be used or shared by such third parties for the primary purpose for which the information was originally collected.

                              Shared information:
                              We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
                              These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
                              Though LoopNet makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request served on our website and to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
                              LoopNet shares member information in the following areas on the site: Listing Service, Email Alerts and Professional Directory. When a member enters a sale or lease listing in the Listing Service, listing contact information is also entered. During this process, the listing submitter is able to view other members' contact information when he adds another contact beside himself to the listing. In addition, members searching LoopNet can view contact information (name, email and phone number) when they view a property listing profile. LoopNet allows users to share contact information with one another via its Email Alerts service. With Email Alerts users can save their property search criteria to have information about properties that match the specified criteria emailed to them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their contact information to other users who have property listings that match their criteria. This contact information is then shared with the users who have property listings that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in this section or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph, LoopNet does not share individual user search activity information and such activity information remains private to the individual user and to LoopNet. Professional brokers agree to share their contact information and allow all LoopNet users to view their contact information via the LoopNet Professional Directory or via links made available to users on a listing or in an email. LoopNet users LoopNet shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that LoopNet's partners make of customer information will not exceed LoopNet's use of the data. Key billing information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered from users making online purchases of products or services is provided directly to our credit card processing partner, in order to authorize charges to the credit card. LoopNet also uses third party providers to perform email and postal mailings on behalf of LoopNet, but this information (such as name, address and email) is confidential and is not used by the provider for any other purpose.
                              LoopNet does not rent or lease user information to any third party, except as disclosed here. From time to time, LoopNet may obtain information (such as electronic mail addresses) from third party providers. It is our goal to only contact individuals who we believe may have a legitimate business interest in LoopNet based on their membership or participation in other organizations or websites, and who have indicated a willingness to be contacted for this purpose. While LoopNet endeavors to work with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, LoopNet cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.

("CoStar"), and as a result all LoopNet customer information, including personal, company and listing information, has been and will be shared with CoStar and its affiliates.

                              Though LoopNet makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request served on our website and to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
                              LoopNet shares member information in the following areas on the site: Listing Service, Email Alerts and Professional Directory. When a member enters a sale or lease listing in the Listing Service, listing contact information is also entered. During this process, the listing submitter is able to view other members' contact information when he adds another contact beside himself to the listing. In addition, members searching LoopNet can view contact information (name, email and phone number) when they view a property listing profile. LoopNet allows users to share contact information with one another via its Email Alerts service. With Email Alerts users can save their property search criteria to have information about properties that match the specified criteria emailed to them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their contact information to other users who have property listings that match their criteria. This contact information is then shared with the users who have property listings that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in this section or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph, LoopNet does not share individual user search activity information and such activity information remains private to the individual user and to LoopNet. Professional brokers agree to share their contact information and allow all LoopNet users to view their contact information via the LoopNet Professional Directory or via links made available to users on a listing or in an email. LoopNet users LoopNet shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that LoopNet's partners make of customer information will not exceed LoopNet's use of the data. Key billing information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered from users making online purchases of products or services is provided directly to our credit card processing partner, in order to authorize charges to the credit card. LoopNet also uses third party providers to perform email and postal mailings on behalf of LoopNet, but this information (such as name, address and email) is confidential and is not used by the provider for any other purpose.
                              LoopNet does not rent or lease user information to any third party, except as disclosed here. From time to time, LoopNet may obtain information (such as electronic mail addresses) from third party providers. It is our goal to only contact individuals who we believe may have a legitimate business interest in LoopNet based on their membership or participation in other organizations or websites, and who have indicated a willingness to be contacted for this purpose. While LoopNet endeavors to work with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, LoopNet cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.
                              Please be aware that LoopNet was recently acquired by CoStar Group, Inc. ("CoStar"), and as a result all LoopNet customer information, including personal, company and listing information, has been and will be shared with CoStar and its affiliates. Please be aware that in the event CoStar and/or LoopNet merges with a third party, or in the event all or substantially all of CoStar's and/or LoopNet's assets are acquired by a third party, customer information, including personal, company and listing information, will be shared and/or transferred to such third party. The information may only be used or shared by such third parties for the primary purpose for which the information was originally collected. If such third parties, or if LoopNet for its own business needs, desire to use the personal information for another purpose, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information prior to the information being used for a new purpose, and you will have the opportunity to opt out of such new use of your personal information.
